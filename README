TFWM is a small and fast window manager for X11.
It is based on other window managers of the "tiling" type, is written in C.
Everything about my new window manager is on github: https://github.com/ClassicHellBee


Requirements (software)

To compile tfwm, you will need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local configuration. The default dir where tfwm is installed is /usr/local
Once complete, type the following command to build/compile and install tfwm (if necessary as root):

Executing tfwm
--------------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start tfwm using startx:

In order to connect tfwm to a specific display, make sure that the DISPLAY environment variable is set
correctly, e.g.:

	$ DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec tfwm

This will start tfwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.
